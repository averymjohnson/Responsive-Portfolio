      <p>I graduated from The University of Kansas in 2015 with a Bachelors in English and a minor in Business. During school I worked for finance publisher Institutional Investor in New York City as a conference intern. </p>

      <p>Following school I worked for Capital Trading Group in Chicago, Il as a commodities and futures trader in the Board of Trade. While working at CTG, I obtained my Series 3 to become a licenses broker in futures and commodities. After a year there, I returned to the Kansas City area and started working for State Street Corporation. There I price international mutual funds, based out of Luxembourg and Ireland, for clients UBS and Deutsche Bank.</p>

      <p>Although the finance world has been good to me, I have been interested in coding and web development since the early days of MySpace. I decided to see this interest through and enroll in a coding bootcamp that would give me the knowledge and tools to succeed in this line of work. </p>
